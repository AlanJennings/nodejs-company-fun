# nodejs-company-fun
Simple dashboard to show upcoming company events
This came from a hack I put together at a company hackday to run on a raspberry pi to display a few different dashboards for developers

Iteration One
- NodeJS hosted app
- Python dirty script that pulls together text file into html
- html iframe or whatnot displaying company events and other tabs

Iteration Two
- mysql db install
- mysql db for form
- form to submit company events

Iteration Three
- use the GDS toolkit to make it look pretty

Iteration Four
- Admin rules and logins
